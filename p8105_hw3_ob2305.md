# Problem 1

  - How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most items
    ordered from?

There are 134 isles and most items are ordered from the fresh vegetables
aisle.

``` r
instacart %>% 
  count(aisle)
```

  - Make a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle,
    limiting this to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered. Arrange
    aisles sensibly, and organize your plot so others can read it.

Fresh vegetables, fresh fruits, packaged vegetables fruits, yourt and
packaged cheese are the top 5 ordered products.

``` r
instacart %>% 
  count(aisle, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  filter( n > 10000) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = n, y = aisle))+
  geom_point()
```

<img src="p8105_hw3_ob2305_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="90%" />

  - Make a table showing the three most popular items in each of the
    aisles “baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged
    vegetables fruits”. Include the number of times each item is ordered
    in your table.

For “baking ingredients” 3 most popular itens are Organic Baby Spinach,
Organic Raspberries and Organic Blueberries in descending order. For
“packaged vegetables fruits” they are Light Brown Sugar, Pure Baking
Soda and Cane Sugar. For “dog food care” the are Snack Sticks Chicken &
Rice Recipe Dog Treats, Organix Chicken & Brown Rice Recipe and Small
Dog Biscuits.

``` r
bi = instacart %>%
  filter(aisle == "baking ingredients") %>%
  group_by(aisle, product_name) %>% 
  summarize(n = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) %>% 
  head(3)

dfc = instacart %>%
  filter(aisle == "dog food care") %>% 
  group_by(aisle, product_name) %>% 
  summarize(n = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>% 
  head(3)

pvf = instacart %>%
  filter(aisle == "packaged vegetables fruits") %>% 
  group_by(aisle, product_name) %>% 
  summarize(n = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>% 
  head(3) 

aisles_3 = 
  bind_rows(bi, dfc, pvf) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))
```

  - Make a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady
    Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week;
    format this table for human readers (i.e. produce a 2 x 7 table).

During the week coffee ice cream is ordered in the afternoon, while on
saturday they are ordered at noon mostly. Apples are mostly ordered in
the first half of the day and not later than 2 pm.

``` r
hour_of_day = instacart %>% 
  select(product_name, order_dow, order_hour_of_day) %>% 
  filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) %>% 
  group_by(product_name, order_dow) %>% 
  summarize(
    mean_time_of_day = mean(order_hour_of_day))
  
hour_of_day %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = order_dow,
    values_from = mean_time_of_day)%>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 1)
```

| product\_name    |    0 |    1 |    2 |    3 |    4 |    5 |    6 |
| :--------------- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Coffee Ice Cream | 13.8 | 14.3 | 15.4 | 15.3 | 15.2 | 12.3 | 13.8 |
| Pink Lady Apples | 13.4 | 11.4 | 11.7 | 14.2 | 11.6 | 12.8 | 11.9 |

``` r
hour_of_day %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = order_dow, y = mean_time_of_day, color = product_name))+
  geom_line()+
  labs(
    title = "Hour of order",
    x = "Day of order",
    y = "Mean time of day (Hour)")
```

# Problem 2

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("brfss_smart2010")

brfss = brfss_smart2010 %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  filter(topic == "Overall Health") %>%
  rename(
    state = locationabbr, 
    county = locationdesc)
```

  - Check all possible responses

Responses include Excellent, Very good, Good, Fair anf Poor, so include
all of them.

``` r
brfss %>%
  count(response)
```

    ## # A tibble: 5 x 2
    ##   response      n
    ##   <chr>     <int>
    ## 1 Excellent  2125
    ## 2 Fair       2125
    ## 3 Good       2125
    ## 4 Poor       2125
    ## 5 Very good  2125

``` r
brfss = brfss %>%
  filter(response %in% c("Excellent", "Very good", "Good", "Fair", "Poor")) %>% 
  mutate(
    response = factor(response, levels = c("Excellent", "Very good", "Good", "Fair", "Poor"))) %>% 
  arrange(desc(response)) 
```

  - In 2002, which states were observed at 7 or more locations?

The “CT” “FL” “MA” “NC” “NJ” “PA” are the states which were observed at
7 or more locations in 2002.

``` r
first = brfss %>% 
  filter(year =="2002") %>% 
  group_by(state) %>%
  summarize(n_location = n_distinct(county)) %>% 
  filter(n_location >=7)

x = pull(first, state) 
```

  - What about in 2010?

The “CA” “CO” “FL” “MA” “MD” “NC” “NE” “NJ” “NY” “OH” “PA” “SC” “TX”
“WA” are the states which were observed at 7 or more locations in
2010.

``` r
second = brfss %>% 
  filter(year =="2010") %>% 
  group_by(state) %>%
  summarize(n_location = n_distinct(county)) %>% 
  filter(n_location >=7)

y = pull(second, state)
```

  - Construct a dataset that is limited to Excellent responses, and
    contains, year, state, and a variable that averages the data\_value
    across locations within a state. Make a “spaghetti” plot of this
    average value over time within a state (that is, make a plot showing
    a line for each state across years – the geom\_line geometry and
    group aesthetic will help).

Spaghetti plot depicts average data value for “Excellent” responses for
time range of 2002 - 2010. Each state is depicted by different color.

``` r
brfss %>% 
  select(year, state, county, response, data_value) %>% 
  filter(response == "Excellent") %>% 
  group_by(response, year, state) %>% 
  summarize(
    ave_data_value = mean(data_value)
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = ave_data_value, color = state))+
  geom_line()
```

<img src="p8105_hw3_ob2305_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png" width="90%" />

  - Make a two-panel plot showing, for the years 2006, and 2010,
    distribution of data\_value for responses (“Poor” to “Excellent”)
    among locations in NY State.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
brfss %>%
  select(state, year, data_value, response) %>% 
  filter(state =="NY", year %in% c(2006, 2010)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = data_value, fill = response))+
  geom_density(alpha = .5)+
  facet_grid(~year)
```

# Problem 3

``` r
chf = read_csv(file = "./data/accel_data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  mutate(
    week_time = if_else(day == "Saturday" | day == "Sunday", "weekend", "weekday")) %>% 
  select(week, day_id, day,week_time, everything()) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    activity_1:activity_1440,
    names_to = "activity_time",
    names_prefix = "activity_",
    values_to = "value") 
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   .default = col_double(),
    ##   day = col_character()
    ## )

    ## See spec(...) for full column specifications.

Tidied data set has 6 variables with names:week, day\_id, day,
week\_time, activity\_time, value and 50400 data entries.

``` r
chf %>% head()
```

    ## # A tibble: 6 x 6
    ##    week day_id day    week_time activity_time value
    ##   <dbl>  <dbl> <chr>  <chr>     <chr>         <dbl>
    ## 1     1      1 Friday weekday   1              88.4
    ## 2     1      1 Friday weekday   2              82.2
    ## 3     1      1 Friday weekday   3              64.4
    ## 4     1      1 Friday weekday   4              70.0
    ## 5     1      1 Friday weekday   5              75.0
    ## 6     1      1 Friday weekday   6              66.3

  - Traditional analyses of accelerometer data focus on the total
    activity over the day. Using your tidied dataset, aggregate accross
    minutes to create a total activity variable for each day, and create
    a table showing these totals. Are any trends apparent?

This spaghetti plot depicts total activity for the specific day over the
course of 5 weeks. Monday of week 3 appears to be the day with the
highest activity level, while saturday of week 5 has no activity at all.
It appears that activity level overall started to go down after week 3.

``` r
chf %>% 
  group_by(week, day) %>% 
  summarize(
    total_activity_per_day = sum(value)
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = total_activity_per_day, color = day))+
  geom_line()+
  labs(
    title = "5 Weeks activity profile",
    x = "Week",
    y = "Activity value for the day")
```

  - Accelerometer data allows the inspection activity over the course of
    the day. Make a single-panel plot that shows the 24-hour activity
    time courses for each day and use color to indicate day of the week.
    Describe in words any patterns or conclusions you can make based on
    this graph.

This plot depicts activity value of the patient for every minute of the
5 weeks. It appears that Wednesdays have lower activity level compared
to other days, while Fridays were the most active during the last week
of trial.

``` r
hour_data = 
  chf %>%
  group_by(week, day, day_id) %>%
  mutate(
   activity_time = as.numeric(activity_time),
    hour_activity = (activity_time)%/%60)
```

``` r
hour_data %>% 
  filter(hour_activity != "24") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = activity_time, y = value, color = day, group = day_id))+
  geom_line(alpha = .5)+
  labs(
    title = "24 hour activity profile",
    x = "Minutes",
    y = "Activity Measure")
```
