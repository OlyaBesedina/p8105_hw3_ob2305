Make a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle,
limiting this to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered. Arrange
aisles sensibly, and organize your plot so others can read it.

``` r
instacart %>% 
  count(aisle, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  filter( n > 10000) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = n, y = aisle))+
  geom_point()
```

Make a table showing the three most popular items in each of the aisles
“baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged vegetables
fruits”. Include the number of times each item is ordered in your
table.

``` r
bi = instacart %>%
  filter(aisle == "baking ingredients") %>%
  group_by(aisle, product_name) %>% 
  summarize(n = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) %>% 
  head(3)

dfc = instacart %>%
  filter(aisle == "dog food care") %>% 
  group_by(aisle, product_name) %>% 
  summarize(n = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>% 
  head(3)

pvf = instacart %>%
  filter(aisle == "packaged vegetables fruits") %>% 
  group_by(aisle, product_name) %>% 
  summarize(n = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>% 
  head(3) 

aisles_3 = 
  bind_rows(bi, dfc, pvf) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))
```

Make a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady Apples
and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week; format this
table for human readers (i.e. produce a 2 x 7 table).
